2021-04-27 MatList
Still Broken:
- auto-refresh soon after queue/dequeue writ, inventory/bank/craft bag change.
- HONOR MIMIC STONES: teach smithing how to honor 'em and omit from matlist?
    - how to plumb a line from UI to Smithing parser :ToMatList()
- UI to toggle matlist window from main WW list window


2021-04-24 MatList
- basics functioning, good enough for my own use (barely)

Want:
- Initial sort, sort after refresh, is QUITE broken
- would also like to numeric-sort abbreviated/gold/nillable columns

- UI to show/hide "sufficient rows" so that I can just focus on "what's missing?"
    - show "all materials" / "missing materials" [ / "missing motif pages"]
- click to toggle material's item tooltip
- auto-refresh soon after queue/dequeue writ
- HONOR MIMIC STONES: teach smithing how to honor 'em and omit from matlist?
    - how to plumb a line from UI to Smithing parser :ToMatList()
- UI to toggle matlist window from main WW list window

- Mat tooltips
    - Full text, one mat per line
    - abbreviated with icons a la Marify? Nah.
    - show only missing mats
    - off
    - Interaction with Show Duplicates:
        - switch to SHOW DUPLICATES upon turning Mat tooltips to any ON
        - switch mat tooltips to OFF upon turning off SHOW DUPLICATES

2020-12-23
- Tooltip support for Marify's Master Writ Confirm
    - Option to hide Tooltip additions and let Marify's tooltip stuff cover it.
        - Marify covers motif, skills, and inventory
        - Marify does not cover cost
    - Option to SHOW mat counts in tooltip similar to how Marify does it

    Current/New tooltip additions       Duplicates Marify?  K
    - motif knowledge for piece         dup                 KNOW_MOTIF
    - recipe knowledge                  dup                 KNOW_RECIPE
    - trait knowledge for piece         dup                 KNOW_TRAIT
    - trait ct knowledge for set        dup                 KNOW_TRAITS_FOR_SET
    - mat reduction skill warn          ---                 KNOW_SKILL_COST_REDUCTION
    - mat cost                          ---                 MAT_COST
    - mat inventory need/have           soon!               MAT_LIST
    - skill knowledge for recipe        not_ww              n/a

    Make a table, probably under WritWorthy.Know.KNOW.{MOTIF,RECIPE....}
        .duplicates_marify
    Not sure I want to refactor out all the Know:New() calls to table references.

- Finish the damn mat list window
- AGS integration needs a repair, AGAIN
- Can I fix the auto-exit from station after last crafting, or is LLC still munged?

# 2019-12-18 /ww inv

Record to SavedVariables each
- master writ in inventory
- master writ in bank
- master writ in accessible home storage

For each record:
- item_link
- crafting_type abbr
- bag_name or char_name
- smithing item, style, trait, qual, know_list violation string
- mat_list


# 2019-09-28
-- /writworthy auto: "Oopening writs..." show N/M how many in bag for progress
-- Why no auto-disconnect from station after last crafting?
-- Why 1st several stations no HSM indicator? Did I exceed some limit?
-- Would like a writ count at bottom of WW window, along with other summary numbers



A better way to find skill lines for the 7 crafting skills

* GetCraftingSkillLineIndices(*[TradeskillType|#TradeskillType]* _craftingSkillType_)

** _Returns:_ *[SkillType|#SkillType]* _skillType_, *luaindex* _skillLineIndex_

2018-07-30 3D indicator over "next crafting station"

From HarvestMap: a ton of libraries. Which do I really need?

Lib3D by Shinni
    http://www.esoui.com/downloads/info1664-Lib3D.html
    LibGPS2 required
    LibMapPing required
    Seems to handle scale factors for maps, coord/meter conversion
    Lacks scale info for player housing, but probably could be added easily.
    "HousingWorld" vs. "PersistenWorld or just 'World'"
    Origin is NW corner with increasing values of X,Z going East, South

LibGPS by Sirinsidiator, votan
    aka LibGPS2
    LibMapPing required
    maps and waypoints and map clicks
    local/zone/global X,Y conversions

Not sure we HAVE to use any of this if we're in HousingWorld, where coordinates are in centimeters and the origin never changes out from under us as the player moves about (unlike in the full world, where the origin resets to player position every 1km)

HarvestMap/InRangePins.lua
    is where the worldMarker.dds texture is loaded

function InRangePins:GetNewWorldControl(
      pinTypeId
    , globalX
    , globalY
    , worldZ
    , version
    )

    pin / beam / icon

    beam:Create3DRenderSpace()
    beam:Set3DRenderSpaceOrigin(x,y,z)
    beam:Set3DLocalDimensions(width,height)

    ^ These are ZOS functions for controls

GetNumSmithingTraitItems() → 34

Weird
GetSmithingResearchLineTraitDescriptions(
      number TradeskillType craftingSkillType
    , number researchLineIndex
    , number traitIndex
    )
Returns:
    string traitDescription
    , string traitResearchSourceDescription
    , string traitMaterialSourceDescription
No "Nirnhoned" or anything useful like that.
"Increases healing done". Yawn

GetSmithingTraitItemInfo(ITEM_TRAIT_TYPE_ARMOR_DIVINES + 1)
    1     Search on ESOUI Source Code GetSmithingTraitItemInfo(number traitItemIndex)
        Returns: number:nilable ItemTraitType traitType, string itemName, textureName icon, number sellPrice, boolean meetsUsageRequirement, number itemStyleId, number ItemQuality quality


Nope: ITEM_TRAIT_TYPE_ARMOR_DIVINES → link to Garnet
    Uh wait, Garnet isn't Divines. Need to +1. Ugh.

GetSmithingTraitItemLink(number traitItemIndex + 1, number LinkStyle linkStyle)
        Returns: string link

GetHighestItemStyleId()  → 86
